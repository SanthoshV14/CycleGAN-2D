# CycleGAN-2D
CBCT to CT translation using CycleGAN model

2D CycleGAN model for image-to-image translation between CBCT and CT images. The model was trained using the Pelvic Reference Data (https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Pelvic-Reference-Data). The trained model can be downloaded for further use from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E25Sq7GHRSBnPZrWGQ9ohKSFC7UQuChd?usp=share_link
